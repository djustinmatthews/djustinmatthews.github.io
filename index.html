He was an agnostic until the age of 25 when he came to faith in Jesus Christ. A short time later he came to understand and embrace the doctrines of grace. Jeff and his wife Andrea (Andy) have been married since 1996 and have four children: Walker, Nate, Drew, and Shelby. The Reddings are thankful to be a part of Walton Community Church and love Georgia, especially the beauty of springtime and fall (which provide glorious hints of the new earth to come). Jeff works full-time in the legal field in Atlanta. He enjoys reading and discussing books – some of his favorite authors are R.C. Sproul, Tim Keller, Chris Wright, Leif Enger, C.J. Sansom, Patrick O’Brian, Wendell Berry, and P.D. James. He also enjoys working in the yard, bird watching, lifting (light) weights, riding his bike (slowly and for short distances), playing Settlers of Catan, and losing to his kids in one-on-one basketball.</p>

They have been married for 43 years; he is the father of two daughters, Heather and Amy; two son-in-laws, Chris and Jonathan; and 5 grandchildren, Benjamin, Sam, Charlee, Ali and James. Greg was born in Chicago, Illinois but has lived in Georgia for most of his life. God brought salvation to Greg at the age of 18 while on a church youth choir trip and was baptized shortly thereafter. God used college friends to hold him accountable as a young, growing Christian while at Middle Tennessee State University and the University of Georgia. Greg is a retired high school band director as well as a retired AP Music Theory, Beginning Music Theory and Music Appreciation instructor for the Georgia Virtual School. He was a teacher for 43 years. Greg loves the Lord and serving as an elder and looks forward to the extra time he will now have, since he has recently retired, in serving the Lord at WCC.

The Lord graciously saved him and his brother at the same time as young boys at Parkwood Hills Baptist Church. Steve has been married to his beautiful bride Kristi for 34 yrs. They have 3 grown children and 4 grandchildren. They love serving in God’s church through music, teaching, hospitality and worshiping with fellow believers. Steve was ordained as a Deacon in 2004 at Rockdale Community Church where he has actively served for most of that time. When RCC determined to open a church plant in the Monroe area, Steve and Kristi felt God’s call to help and reach out to the community in which they have lived for 14 years. We are excited how God has prepared the way for Walton Community Church and look forward to ministering, serving and worshiping our great God with the people of Walton and surrounding counties as He leads.</p>

Benjamin and Charlee keep them busy with theater through school and Oconee Youth School of Performance, and Sam is training in ninja and parkour at Oconee Ninja World.  Chris was saved in 1992 through his youth group in Swainsboro, GA.  God continued to grow him in his faith at Berry College where he met Heather. Chris has worked as an AV design engineer for 16 years and has had the opportunity to work with churches throughout the country to help develop technology systems that support their worship.  In 2016, Chris and his family were called to the Athens area to continue that line of work with TSAV, a technology design and integration firm in the commercial industry.  Since that move, they have been praying for God to open an opportunity to worship in the area. Through the past 25 years Chris has been blessed to have the opportunity to lead worship in many different church environments including church plants, established churches,  and missionary churches overseas.   Chris and Heather are grateful and excited for the opportunity to continue leading in worship now in Walton County – a community close to home. </p>

Although our congregation is on the younger side, we hold to the historic beliefs of the Protestant Reformation and our services are probably considered more traditional/ancient/historic (e.g., we often read out loud the Lord’s Prayer and the Apostles’ Creed, and we often sing the Doxology or the Gloria Patri). After service, please consider staying a few minutes for complimentary coffee so we can get to know you.</p>

                                    <p>Absolutely. We would be privileged if you joined us, regardless if you are a Christian, a skeptic, or exploring Christianity. Many of us (including the teachers/ preachers) did not grow up in the church, were skeptics, or came to faith later in life. You will absolutely be welcomed at WCC. Also, because learning about something new takes time, we would encourage you to return each week and continue exploring. (We know this is asking a lot, but we hope you’ll take us up on our invitation.)</p>

However, we do pray for other churches in the community every Sunday in our corporate prayer. We do not believe that WCC is the only church in the Walton Community that is serving Jesus!</p>
