                    <p style="text-align: left;">Welcome! Many of us at WCC come from a variety of church backgrounds—or no church background at all. We know that visiting a church and finding a church home can be difficult. Our desire at WCC is to make all visitors feel welcome, regardless of background. May the true and living God be honored in the church and in all of our lives. <em>Soli Deo Gloria!</em></p>

                                    <p>Walton Community Church (“WCC”) is an intentional church plant sent out from Rockdale Community Church in Conyers, Georgia. Many of our church members live in Monroe and other parts of Walton County, and it’s been their desire to worship and serve the Lord in their own community. In the summer of 2017, a core group of eight families began meeting together to pray and discuss the possibility of a church plant in Walton County. By God’s grace, WCC was commissioned as a church plant in February 2018, and our first Sunday morning worship service was held on February 18, 2018.</p>

                                    <p>WCC exists for the glory of God. That’s why one of the phrases you will often see and hear around our church is Soli Deo Gloria: To God Alone Be the Glory! We are made by God to glorify and enjoy Him through His Son, Jesus Christ. It is only through the life, death, and resurrection of our Lord Jesus that we have peace with God and the assured hope of heaven. For this reason, our church strives to be centered around and focused on the life-transforming gospel of Jesus Christ.<br /> <br /> We seek to love and honor God through studying His Word, singing and praying together, partaking of the Lord’s Supper, sharing the gospel through evangelism and missions, and loving and serving one another and our neighbors. Although our week revolves around Sunday when we gather for corporate worship, our life together as a church goes beyond Sunday mornings. We desire to meet regularly for times of prayer, to share meals, and to minister to our community. </p>

The class will provide a more detailed look at our church’s beliefs, structure, culture, and mission. <br /> <br />We would love for you to become a member of WCC as we seek to serve the Lord together as a church family. But most of all, our heart’s desire is for you to be actively serving in a Bible-believing church that exalts Jesus Christ. If you decide that another church is where you need to serve the Lord, then we will praise God with you that you have found a church home. Please do not hesitate to contact us and let us know how we can pray for you and your church.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: left;">We worship the Lord together at 9:00 a.m. Our corporate worship is centered around the Word of God and focused on Jesus Christ. One of the distinguishing marks of WCC is that our times of worship are truly congregational. During a typical Sunday morning service, the congregation participates in worship through responsive readings, congregational singing, and the corporate reading of scripture passages or historic statements of faith, such as the Apostles’ Creed. By reading truth together and singing truth together, we seek to have the word of Christ dwell in us richly.</p>

                                    <p>One of our church leaders, on behalf of the congregation, will lead us as we bring our prayers of adoration, confession, thanksgiving, and supplication to our gracious Lord who hears us.  At the conclusion of our corporate prayer, we will often pray the Lord’s Prayer together as a congregation.</p>

                                    <p>Preaching at WCC is exegetical, which means that we seek to explain the meaning of a biblical text. Sermons are usually between 35 to 45 minutes long. Our goal in preaching and hearing is to understand and apply the Word of God to our daily lives. The gospel of Jesus Christ is what drives our preaching.</p>

                                    <p>After the sermon, we partake of the Lord’s Supper. This is a time of reflection, self-examination, and communion with our Savior. The Lord’s table is a “family meal” that is open to all Christians. We joyfully observe the Lord’s Supper every Sunday morning.</p>
